# Project S

An all-in-one solution to your Discord Bot needs. Whatever you may need for your server, chances are this bot can provide. If a feature you need is not currently supported, you can create an issue proposing its addition using the `Feature Request` tag. Once your request has been approved, a Core Developer will change the status to `New Feature` and begin work.

# Contributing

Currently, contributions are locked to a select group of verified developers. If you would like to be added to this group, please contact the developer (Savant#7066 on Discord) for an interview. Your interview will consist of:

- Questions about your history with Python & discord.py
- A review of any projects you developed or have worked extensively on
- Your proposed solution for an issue that both you and the interviewer agree upon

Once the interview is completed, you will be granted access to the repository as a Core Developer.
If you have any questions, you can contact the Development Lead (Savant#7066 on Discord)

# Features

Project S has several features, with more in development! In the case you would like a feature added, you can propose it using an issue. Before proposing a feature request, please ensure it meets the following guidelines:

- The feature is SFW (with Discord's age limit set to 13, we don't want to provide any NSFW content)
- The feature does not violate a third-party's Terms of Service Agreement (this inlcudes streaming YouTube content)
- The feature cannot be harmful or in any way malicious - this includes **spamming**
- The feature has a possibilty to be utilized by other guilds (i.e. it is not unique to your guild)

If you aren't sure if your request meets these guidelines, you can ask in the support server's `#feed-back` channel
